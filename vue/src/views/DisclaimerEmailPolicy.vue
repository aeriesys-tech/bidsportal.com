                        <p>
                            Subscriptions: BidsPortal bills the subscribers using a prorated, recurring payment system for subscriptions that recur on a monthly, semi-annual or annual basis dependent upon the date of the first payment and
                            selected subscription plan upon payment. Prior to forthcoming billing cycle, the payment method is processed at the select time interval. If a renewal payment fails or is expired and not updated, the User will be
                            notified by BidsPortal and access to BidsPortal's services will be suspended until payment is received. BidsPortal may attempt to renew the card at a later date unless the User requests a cancellation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recurring payments: Unless a subscriber specifies in written or electronic communication to cancel and or not automatically renew, all subscriptions with BidsPortal are term subscriptions that renew at a later
                            date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Monthly subscriptions: All monthly payments are automatic and final. The User is not notified prior to the renewal date. Cancellation will prevent any further charges from occurring, as long as cancellation
                            occurs prior to renewal. Please view the Termination of Services section for more clarity.

                            Semi-annual and annual subscriptions: Semi-annual and annual subscriptions will auto-renew until you cancel the service. Every time before your subscription auto-renews, we will send an email specifying the
                            amount that will be charged to your credit card. Similarly, after each renewal we will send you a receipt via email specifying the amount that has been deducted together with the next renewal date and the next
                            renewal amount.

                        <p>
                            BidsPortal will continue to provide the Services to you (and you will be entitled to utilise the Services) for the term of your subscription. The term of your subscription will automatically renew for a further
                            term on payment of your subscription.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BidsPortal may from time to time increase the amount of subscriptions. Any increase will be notified to you at least 30 days before it is implemented and you will be given the opportunity to opt out of continuing
                            your subscription. If you do not opt out, your subscription will be renewed at the increased rate. Where we are authorized to deduct payments using your credit card, Pay Pal or other means, you authorize us to
                            deduct the increased amount of your subscription.

                            agreement and, in the case of a breach which is capable of being remedied, you fail to remedy the breach within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the breach; (c) you fail to pay any amount due to BidsPortal
                            within 21 days of receiving a written demand for payment; (d) you are subject to any application for winding up or liquidation, or for the appointment of a liquidator, receiver or manager, or are subject to any
                            other form of insolvency event; or (e) BidsPortal ceases to provide the Services.
